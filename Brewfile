#
# Running `brew leaves` will show installed formulae that are not dependencies
# of another installed formula.
#
# To generate a base Brewfile run the following commands:
#
#   `brew tap | sed "s/^.*/tap '&'/" > Brewfile`
#   `brew leaves | sed "s/^.*/brew '&'/" >> Brewfile`
#
# To generate a Brewfile listing all installed packages, casks, and dependecies,
# run the command `brew bundle dump -f > Brewfile`
#
# This Brewfile can also be used as a whitelist and uninstall all Homebrew
# formulae not listed in Brewfile by using the command `brew bundle cleanup`
#
